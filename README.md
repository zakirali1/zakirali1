### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me:

I've been coding for a few years now and have learnt a few languages along the way. Which include:
* Javascript 
* Python 
* Java. 


### **My Journey to Code**

It has been nothing short of mindblowing.

Filled with many ups :flight_departure: and downs :flight_arrival:


### I'm looking to collaborate on...

| language  | Projects |
|-----:|---------------|
|     Python | Django App              |
|     PERN |   Full stack App            |
|     Java  |   Mock Banking App            |

The above projects would greatly help my _learning_

### Fun fact:

I once played football with prince and absolutely thrashed him. He was so upset he released a single called purple rain. :man_dancing:
